    """This class is a context manager that's used to manage a transaction's context relating
    to an incoming nuropb service message. When a class instance's method is decorated with the
    nuropb_context decorator, the context manager is instantiated and injected into the method
    as a ctx parameter.

    The nuropb context manager is both a sync and async context manager. Events can be added
    to the context manager and will be sent to the service mesh when the context manager
    successfully exits. If an exception is raised while the context manager is in scope, the
    exception is recorded and the transaction in context is considered to have failed. Any
    events added to the context manager are discarded.
