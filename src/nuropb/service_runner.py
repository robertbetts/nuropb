""" This module provides the runtime configuration for the RabbitMQ transport.
- NuroPb Service leader election
- RMQ Exchange and Queue configuration

A service Leader is elected using etcd. The leader is responsible for creating the RMQ Exchange and Queues,
and binding the Queues to the Exchange. Due to the additional administrative responsibilities, the leader's
message prefetch size should be smaller relative to the other service instances.

TODO: The service leader is also responsible for monitoring and managing overall service health.
- if the service queue is not draining fast enough, the leader will signal for additional instances to be started.
- if the service queue is draining too fast, the leader will signal for instances to be stopped.
- Connections to RMQ that are initiating service messages with high error rates will be terminated.
- The leader will also monitor the dead letter queue and take action if the dead letter queue is growing too fast.

NuroPb services instances wait for the elected leader to signal that the RMQ Exchange and Queues are ready before
connecting and starting to consume messages from the RMQ Queues.
