Do you have a Python class that you want to make available as a service to consumers or other services, or
* You potentially want to scale a service horizontally many times over, likely at an unknown scale.
* Your service may need to communicate to other services
* There are event driven processes and flows across your service landscape
* You have websocket endpoints that need to integrate seamlessly across a service mesh and event driven architecture
* A growing army of Ml-Ops and Datascience engineers are joining, with the need to to integrate their efforts
  across many systems.
* Needing a service proxy that bridges cloud VPNs and on-premise networks

If any of these are of interest to you, then NuroPb is worth considering. NuroPb It falls into the domain of  
tools and frameworks for the abstraction of integration plumbing, enabling software engineers to focus on the
problems they're hired to solve.

## Where does the name originate from?
NuroPb is a contraction of the term nervous system and the scientific symbol for Lead. Lead
associated with plumbing. So NuroPb is a system's nervous system and plumbing.
